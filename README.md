# About the project
The goal behind this project is to create a self-contained (does not rely on any external dependencies) vector library written in C# .NET Standard 2.1 to solve 3d geometry interactions. 

This library was built using .Net Standard, so it is usable in .Net 5 and all later versions (for reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-1-0).
