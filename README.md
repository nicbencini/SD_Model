# SD_Vector
 
The goal behind this project is to create a self-contained (does not rely on any external dependencies) vector library written in C# .NET Standard 2.1 to solve 3d geometry interactions. There are faster and better geometry libraries out there written in other programming languages however the goal of this project is to create a library written entirely in C# with all code and math behind the project visible and clear for all. 

This library was built using .Net Standard, so it is usable in .Net 5 and all later versions (for reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard?tabs=net-standard-1-0).

The intention is to keep this project entirely open source and free to use under the MIT license.

This is currently still work-in-progress and in its early phases so any contributions or input would be welcome so please don't hesitate to contact me.
